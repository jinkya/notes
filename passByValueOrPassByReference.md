# Call by value and Call by reference

### Intro
A great theory is developed to determine _when_ to evaluate the argument(s) of a function call for function and _what kind_ of value to pass to the function.
For more details, The Evaluation strategies reference in [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy)

### Primary Terms
	name = 'ajinkya'
	Value =  'ajinkya'
	address (memory location) = 0x7fd5d258dd00 (just a random hex)

### Authentic definition 
-   When a parameter is  **passed by reference**, the caller and the callee  **use the same variable**  for the parameter. If the callee modifies the parameter variable, the effect is visible to the caller's variable.
    
-   When a parameter is  **passed by value**, the caller and callee have  **two independent variables**with the same value. If the callee modifies the parameter variable, the effect is not visible to the caller.  
*caller is calling the callee

For getting more clarity of the memory with reference to pass by reference and pass by valur refer this [cool article](https://www.mathwarehouse.com/programming/passing-by-value-vs-by-reference-visual-explanation.php)

### Language Agnostic Approach

#### Javascript
Javascript is always pass by value but when a var refers to an object(including arrays), the "value" is a reference to the object.

	function f1(a,b,c){
		a = 5;
		b.push('flag_jinkya');
		c.val = true;
	}

	x = 1;
	y = [ 'flag_0', 'flag_1' ];
	z = { val : false };

	console.log(x,y,z); // 1 ["flag_0", "flag_1"] { val: false }
	f1(x,y,z);
	console.log(x,y,z); // 1 ["flag_0", "flag_1", "flag_jinkya"] { val: true }

Doesn't it seem much easier? Wait its not that simple  

	function f2(a,b,c){
		a = a*10;
		b.val = "hero";
		c = { val: "heroine" }
	}

	x = 1;
	y = { val: "Ajinkya" };
	z = { val: "Anamika" };

	console.log(x,y,z); // 1 {val: "Ajinkya"} {val:"Anamika"}
	f2(x,y,z);
	console.log(x,y,z); // 1 {val: "hero"} {val:"Anamika"}
	
Now go duck and draw your own conclusion. ðŸ˜‰  
If you change the parameter itself that will not affect the item that is fed into parameter, but changing internals of a parameter that will propagate up.    
Technically it is [call by sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_sharing).

#### Python 
Well, I tried to go through Python Docs and they avoids using either term.  
But I would like to navigate you to [this article](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/) which says its neither which might makes it more confusing.
