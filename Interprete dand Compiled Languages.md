## Interpreted Language  
a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute  
instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program  into machine-language instructions

## Compiled Language 
a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers  (translators that generate machine code  
from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no pre-runtime translation takes place).  

## Background  
In Early Days, language design was heavily influenced by the decision to use compiling or interpreting  
as a mode of execution. Most so-called interpreted languages use an intermediate representation,   
which combines compiling and interpreting.  
  
The terms interpreted language and compiled language are not well defined  because, in theory, any programming language  
can be either interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation, it is increasingly  
popular for a platform to provide both options.  
  
Many languages have been implemented using both compilers and interpreters,   
including BASIC, C, Lisp, Pascal, and Python.  
  
  
Just to be honest it's not about the language, its about the language implementation and modern platforms 
are allowing multiple implementation types for the languages
